# Linear-Regression-with-Gradient-Descent
In this repository, I implement a Linear Regression algorithm with Gradient Descent algorithm. I use the red the wine and white wine dataset.
Both the datasets are uploaded in the repository. 
Some preprocessing has been applied on the datasets.
For both the datasets, a loss graph and an RMSE graph is plotted.
